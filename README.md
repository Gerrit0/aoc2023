# Advent of Code 2023

My solutions, each day in a different language.

The running column assumes your working directory is the current day.

| Language          | Time to complete | Running                       |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| JavaScript (Node) | 15 minutes       | `node answer.js`              |
| Awk (gawk)        | 28 minutes       | `awk -f answer.awk input.txt` |
