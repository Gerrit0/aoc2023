# Advent of Code 2023

My solutions, each day in a different language.

The running column assumes your working directory is the current day.

| Language          | Time to complete                            | Running                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| JavaScript (Node) | 15 minutes                                  | `node answer.js`              |
| Awk (gawk)        | 28 minutes                                  | `awk -f answer.awk input.txt` |
| C                 | 1 hour, 11 minutes                          | `make`                        |
| Lua               | 26 minutes                                  | `lua answer.lua`              |
| Python            | 1 hour, 45 minutes + ~3 hours to run part 2 | `python answer.py`            |
